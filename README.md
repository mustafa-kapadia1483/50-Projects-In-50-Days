Created Expanding cards using vanilla html, css and js. The cards are aligned using display flex and the expanding and shrinking is achieved through listening for a click event in javascript, along with changing the flex property of the cards to grow or shrink them. The images for the cards is fetched from free forza API and the name for the cars is extracted from the image url that the api responds with by using string operations on it. This helped better understand api fetching, flex properties and also how to manipulate DOM elements effectively from JavaScript
